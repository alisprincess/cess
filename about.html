      <h1>Educational Background</h1>
        <p>I started my journey at St. Catherine College of Valenzuela Inc. since Elementary to HighSchool.
            Then I went to Children of Mary Immaculate College, due to the fact that I really wanna try
            commuting. I enrolled at Our Lady of Fatima University but got transfered to St. Louis College
            of Valenzuela. From Accountancy to Financial Management. The course my Mom chose wasn't my forte.
            Thus, i transferred. </p>
